Gnome .desktop files maker

As a Gnome/Linux user, I'd like to have a GUI tool which helps me make .desktop files.
Basically, this tool creates .desktop files that have contents like the following:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=firefox
Exec=/home/dev/firefox/firefox
Icon=/home/dev/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default48.png
Type=Application
Categories=Network
